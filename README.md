# Project Title
Social Network Ads Analysis and Classification

# Description
This project is a Python-based data analysis and machine learning project that focuses on understanding and classifying the purchasing behavior of users in a social network based on their demographic attributes, specifically age and estimated salary.

# Features
Data Exploration: Explore the dataset to gain insights into user demographics and purchasing patterns.

Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data for machine learning, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.

Data Visualization: Create visualizations to better understand the distribution of age, estimated salary, and purchasing behavior.

Logistic Regression Model: Build and train a logistic regression classifier to predict whether a user will make a purchase based on their age and estimated salary.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the confusion matrix.

Decision Boundary Plot: Visualize the decision boundary of the logistic regression model to understand how it separates users who make a purchase from those who do not.

# Technologies Used
Python
NumPy
pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
scikit-learn

# Dataset
The project uses a dataset named 'Social_Network_Ads.csv,' which contains user information, including gender, age, estimated salary, and purchasing behavior (0 for no purchase, 1 for purchase).
